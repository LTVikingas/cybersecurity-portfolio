# Two Mugs Café Cybersecurity Project

This project is a practical demonstration of cybersecurity fundamentals for small businesses, based on my own café.

It includes:

- ✅ An ISO 27001-inspired Information Security Policy  
- ✅ A small business Risk Register  
- ✅ A simplified Audit Checklist  
- ✅ A Nessus vulnerability scan summary  
- ✅ Splunk logs and screenshots  
- ✅ A project summary: "How I Secured My Café"

### Purpose:
To show hands-on understanding of cyber risk management, compliance, and GRC principles using a real-world setting.

### Status:
In development – updated weekly as I build skills through Google Cybersecurity Certificate, Springboard coursework, and labs.
