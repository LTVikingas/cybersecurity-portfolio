This project is a practical demonstration of cybersecurity fundamentals for small businesses, based on my own caf√©.

It includes:

- An ISO 27001-inspired Information Security Policy  
-  A small business Risk Register  
-  A simplified Audit Checklist  
-  A Nessus vulnerability scan summary  
-  Splunk logs and screenshots  
-  A project summary: "How I Secured My Caf√©"

### Purpose:
To show hands-on understanding of cyber risk management, compliance, and GRC principles using a real-world setting.

### Status:
In development ‚Äì updated weekly as I build skills through Google Cybersecurity Certificate, Springboard coursework, and labs.
